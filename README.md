Galactic Nova — Curated Browser Games

Welcome to Galactic Nova, a unique collection of browser games curated for players looking for fun, lesser-known, and creative experiences! This website features a vibrant purple theme with subtle floating particles for a relaxing aesthetic. You can browse games in the Games, Favorites, and Daily Featured tabs, use the search bar to find games by keywords, and open each game in a fullscreen overlay with convenient buttons to favorite it or visit the original site.

If you’re ever unsure about how things work:

Click Play on any game to open it in the overlay.

Use the Visit Original Site button if the game doesn’t load in the embed.

Adjust the volume slider at the bottom-right to control background music, and hover over the mute/unmute button for quick access.

All games included are publicly available online and open for embedding when possible. The site is designed to be fun, easy to navigate, and visually engaging while showcasing creative web projects that you might not have seen before.

Made with 💜 by Breezi.
